# Simple weather page.
_HTML_ + _tailwindcss_ + _JS_ _DOM_ with _openweathermap.org API_.

For API uncomment _"script.js"_ and comment _"mockScript.js"_ in _Head_ section.

**Don't forget enter your openweathermap API-key**.

Unfortunately API doesn't work in github pages, but mocked version you can see [here](https://pavelpaliakou.github.io/weather_page/)
